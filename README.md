# *OXXY

A family of tools to move and proxy log data over various transports with the eventual goal of putting them into Loki

- Loxxy, A loki HTTP proxy that can
  - only deal with authentication
  - publish log data over rabbitmq / mqtt
- Moxxy and Roxxy, A pair of tools to pull data out of rabbitmq queues and mqtt topics
- Toxxy, a test data provider for publishing test logs to mqtt and rabbitmq

## Some Configurations

- Loxxy in your cloud, authenticating logs
- Loxxy on your edge, pushing logs into mqtt topics, Moxxy in your cloud, pushing them to loki
- Loxxy on your edge, pushing logs into mqtt (backed by rabbitmq), Roxxy in your cloud, pushing them to loki
